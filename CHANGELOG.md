# Changelog

All notable changes to the Memory Architecture Quality Standard.

## [Unreleased]
*Ideas and candidates for next version — not yet implemented.*

- D9: Retrieval precision measurement on golden set
- G8: Forgetting cascade (GDPR right to be forgotten — coordinated deletion across all stores)
- `docs/VERIFICATION_QUERIES.md` — example SQL/commands for each [CRIT] item
- Section K: add "Tool" column with example verification tools
- `standard.json` / `standard.yaml` — machine-readable version
- CLI tool `maqs audit` — automated checking of verifiable items

## [1.2] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **Section 2.1** Preparation Phase (7 steps: P1–P7) — mandatory for auditing live systems
- **Section 2.3** Remediation methodology (roadmap, waves, commits)
- **Section 2.4** Diagnostic startup/shutdown scripts as architectural requirement
- **D8** Embedding model language match and versioned migration [CRIT]
- **E10** Protected/alive memory mechanism with capped count [REC]
- **E11** Position-aware injection for long contexts [IMP]
- **I7** Diagnostic dialog protocol — structured agent self-assessment [REC]
- **I8** Personality trait persistence across restarts [IMP]
- **I9** Log rotation — automatic, size-capped [IMP]

### Changed
- **B3** Strengthened: "Source diversity preserved as provenance, not duplicated memory"
- **E1** Clarified: dropping whole low-priority blocks is not blind truncation
- **E4** Relaxed: structured blocks may use lossless alternatives, not only preserved in full
- **F2** Rephrased: principle-based (no memory writes, no history, no feedback) instead of implementation-specific "bare"
- **F3** Bounded instead of impossible: maximum compression depth defined
- **G1** Added testable criterion: must distinguish at least two independently testable scopes
- **I4** Added security/privacy exception for hard deletion
- **J1** Coupled changes explicitly allowed when grouped and documented as single logical unit
- **P4** Added security/privacy exception for deletion during migration
- **P5** Changed from "fix before audit" to "triage and track separately"
